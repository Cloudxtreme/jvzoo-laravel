# jvzoo-laravel
A Laravel package which allows billing through the JVZoo platform using the JVZoo API and IPN system.
Inspired by Laravel's own Cashier package to try and make billing as simple as possible.

## Laravel Versions
jvzoo-laravel is designed to work with Laravel 5.1 LTS. It may work with other versions of Laravel with some tinkering,
but this hasn't been tested.
